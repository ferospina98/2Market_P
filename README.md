NHS Diagnostic Analysis Project

This repository contains a detailed data analysis project focused on NHS appointment trends. The goal of the project is to provide actionable insights into resource allocation, reduce missed appointments, and manage patient demand efficiently.

Project Overview

The National Health Service (NHS) faces challenges in optimizing resource allocation, managing patient loads, and reducing financial losses caused by missed appointments. This project analyzes appointment trends, service settings, and external indicators such as public sentiment to identify opportunities for improvement and recommend data-driven solutions.

Features

	•	Data Preparation:
	•	Imported datasets including appointment data, durations, categories, and public sentiment from social media.
	•	Standardized and cleaned data for analysis by addressing null values, formatting inconsistencies, and handling outliers.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	•	Visualizations to uncover trends in appointments by service setting, healthcare professional type, and seasonal patterns.
	•	Analysis of missed appointments and their financial impact.
	•	Sentiment Analysis:
	•	Insights from public Twitter data using healthcare-related hashtags to assess external influences on NHS demand.

Visualizations and Insights

	•	Boxplots: Show variability in appointment counts across settings, highlighting outliers in GP visits and variability in demand.
	•	Line Charts: Depict monthly trends, emphasizing seasonal peaks, particularly in winter months.
	•	Bar and Scatter Plots: Highlight relationships such as attendance trends and service preferences (e.g., face-to-face vs. telephone).
	•	Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Provides insights into public sentiment, correlating external factors with NHS service usage.

Key Findings

	1.	Seasonal Trends:
	•	Winter months show higher demand, requiring flexible staffing strategies.
	2.	Missed Appointments:
	•	Higher rates observed in GP visits, suggesting the need for automated reminders and rescheduling policies.
	3.	Service Mode Preferences:
	•	Balance between face-to-face and telephone appointments, with seasonal adjustments recommended.
	4.	Social Media as an Indicator:
	•	Public sentiment analysis reveals valuable context for anticipating demand changes.

Recommendations

	•	Dynamic Staffing: Adjust staffing levels based on seasonal demand, particularly in primary care settings.
	•	Missed Appointment Reduction: Implement reminder systems and flexible rescheduling policies in high-miss settings.
	•	Leverage Social Media: Monitor public sentiment in real-time to anticipate demand and adjust resource allocation proactively.

Tools and Libraries

	•	Python Libraries:
	•	pandas for data manipulation.
	•	matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
	•	Additional tools for text and sentiment analysis.
	•	Datasets:
	•	NHS appointment data (appointments_regional.csv, actual_duration.csv, and national_categories.xlsx).
	•	Public sentiment data (tweets.csv).
